    "A number system is like a rulebook for how we write down numbers. It tells us what symbols or digits we can use and what each of these digits means depending on where they are in a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common number system that we use every day is the decimal system. It has ten unique digits: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create any number we want by combining these ten digits in different ways. How? Well, it's all about place value!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the number [234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4doTGQPRPw&ab_channel=KhanAcademyComputing), for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "- 234 = (2 * 100) + (3 * 10) + (4 * 1) = (2 * 10^2) + (3 * 10^1) + (4 * 10^0).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each digit in the number is related to powers of 10. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The last digit, which is 3 in this case, is just 10 to the power of 0, which is always 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, 234 is what we call a **base 10** number because each digit's value is determined by multiplying 10 by itself a certain number of times, depending on where the digit is in the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Aside`: Deconstructing and Reassembling Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of arithmetic, we often encounter situations where we need to manipulate individual digits within a number. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, two fundamental operations, modular arithmetic (`%`) and integer division (`//`), come to our aid, offering elegant solutions for extracting or altering specific digits in base ten numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that base 10 numbers are divisible by 10, we can either integer divide or use moadular arithmetic to extract digits. \n",

    "In the world of computers, speed is everything. The faster a computer can perform tasks, the better it is for us.\n",

    "Now, instead of using the regular number system we're used to (which is decimal and has 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), computers use Binary. \n",

    "Binary is super simpleâ€“it only has two digits: `0` and `1`. You might wonder, why would they pick something with fewer digits? \n",
